- Hey Travel is a website, where user can find a holiday destination for their needs. For their convenience, there are Map with proposed destinations markers. As well, user can choose a travel package from this website. To get inspiration about destinations, there are lot of visual materials placed in different manner, such as Hero sliders, Grid images and Gallery. As well, user has form to contact website owner to get all necessary information.

- Despite to the existing travel situation, people still wants to travel. They are looking for new destinations and possibilities to go out from home. That is mean that any Travel and destinations websites, this version as well, has very high commercial feature. It has modern design and lot of visual component. Design was build using last UI/UX technologies.

## UX

### Project Goals

#### The goals of this project are:
- Design, develop and implement a dynamic front-end web application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Meet the target audience users’ needs using UI/UX design principles
- Implement front-end interactivity, using core JavaScript, JavaScript libraries and/or Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
- Test an interactive front-end web application through the development, implementation and deployment stages
- Deploy an interactive front-end web application to a Cloud platform
- Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system
- Learn JavaScript theory and practically implement all gained knowledge

#### User Goals

- The target audience of this website is very wide. They are different age and status, families or single people.

Common types of users are:
- New customers. The users’ main goal is to get necessary travel information. They are ready for travel and can spend some time to choose a destination. They are ready to get some inspirations from the imaginary and customers’ reviews.

### Design Choices

This project was built based on the target audience needs. As was mentioned above, the target audience is very wide. Very difficult to create design to be liked by the wide range of people.  We know that Nature is pleasant for all people. That mean, some parts of nature should be placed in this project. Colors were taken as representative of the nature as well as nice images. Design is clean and simple. All attention is on images. However, website should stay useful, usable and valuable for both customer and owner. To implement valuable design, were used process of five planes of good user experience:
- **Strategy Plane**  – represents business goals. The main website owner goals were presented above. Just a reminder, that main user of this website will be a business people. Whole design should be kept simple in classical style with some bright elements (in this project Imperial Red color plays as bright element). Design should be plain and modern. Information should be well structured and easy to access. Main parts of the information are placed into top navigation. No more than 3 clicks to get information about website owner. Download button is placed in a footer navigation to get CV printable copy.

- **Scope plane** - represents features we want to include into design. 
  - This project includes following features: 
     - Header navigation.
      - Mobile navigation.
      - Intuitive design.
      - SVG logo on top of the page.
      - Hero Slider.
      - Image Gallery with modal pop up window
      - Grid images as a visual representatives.
      - Google Map with location markers.
      - Contact form.
      - Social media icons.


- **Structure plane** - Information in this project is structured and logically placed into main parts. All parts placed to the navigation. Exception is for Packages. They are not in the navigation and can be accessed through the destinations page. As well, main navigation elements are placed on the homepage into grid system and complimented by the images.

- **Skeleton plane** - part for mock-ups:
  - Wireframes links are presented below:
   - [Link to a Wireframes for a Desctop view](assets/documents/desctop.pdf)
   - [Link to a Wireframes for Tablet view ](assets/documents/tab.pdf)
   - [Link to a Wireframes for Mobile view ](assets/documents/mobile.pdf)

- **Surface plane** - it is a final part of design procedure. The project is built in Classical design style with infusions of modern elements. Abril Fatface font gives additional modern design inclusions. This font curves are not traditional for Travel websites design. It looks more from fashion magazine designs and brings more stylish look. Pale Shades of Blue, Red and green are very pleasant. Colors are associated with water, sun and summer grass. Images are very colourful and attract attention. Website gives a holydays feeling. Same as semi-transparent and grey backgrounds, sliding and fade in animation gives lightweight and elegance.

#### Colors
As I was mentioned above, the color palette were taken to represent colors of Nature. Pale Shades of Blue, Red and green are very pleasant and should associate with water, sun and summer grass. Additionally three shades of grey were used to highlight the colors of Nature. Combination of those colors should create emotional trust and mood of future rest and travel.

- Color palete was created using [Coolors resources](https://coolors.co)
- ![color scheme](assets/images/color-sheme.PNG)

#### Typography
- Elegant Quicksand sans-serif typeface family font, were using in this project for the body text. Body font size is 16px. This body font is easy to read and good for design.
- All titles are in Abril Fatface font’s family.
- According to Google Font, Abril Fatface is a contemporary revamp of classic font, inspired by the heavy titling fonts used in advertising posters in 19th century Britain and France. It has both neutrality and strong presence on the page to attract reader attention with measured tension by its curves, good color and high contrast. 
-  H1 as main title is in size of 50px. It is quite big size, but looks very stylish and attract attention. H2 title is in size of 40px. H3 titles are in size of 30px.
- All fonts are reduced in size for mobile devices to fit into the small screen of devices:
- H1 = 40px, H2 = 35px, H3 = 27px.
- body font is in same size for mobile devices.

- Font examples are presented below:
- H1 Abril Fatface 50px ![H1 Title Abril Fatface 50px](assets/images/h1.PNG)
- H2 Abril Fatface 40px ![H2 Title Abril Fatface 40px](assets/images/h2.PNG)
- H3 Abril Fatface 30px ![H3 Title Abril Fatface 30px](assets/images/h3.PNG)
- Paragraph (body) Quicksand 16px ![p Paragraph Quicksand 16px](assets/images/p.PNG)
- [Abril Fatface font can be found here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Abril+Fatface)
- [Quicksand  font can be found here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand)
 

#### Images
- For user inspiration and Travel destination illustrations, there are used lot of colourful images. Currently, for demonstration purpose were chosen 5 destinations: Ireland, Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Accordingly, images were chosen to represent chosen destinations. 
- Font Awesome icons were used to visually represent all major social media resources. 
- As well were used svg Arrows, Closing icons to demonstrate on website. I created them.
- [Images and logo were taken from the Megapixl resources](https://www.megapixl.com)

#### Animations and Transitions

Project has range of animations. It draws attention to the elements and adding value to the website style and design.
- Animation is added to the following elements:
  - **Zoom in** animation is added to many grid images, images in the Gallery and all social links icons. This animation is not annoying but attract attention to the elements.
  - **Fade in from the bottom** animation is added to the h1, h2 titles. This animation is not annoying too and can be watchable for a long time. This animation is added to the images inside the Gallery Light box too.
  - **Sliding from/to the top** animation is added to the image Gallery light box.
  - **Rotation** animation is added to the closing button on Gallery Light box, 
  - **Hover** state is used for all icons and buttons. On hover, they are changing background and text colors. Hover effect is added to top navigation elements too. 

### Wireframes
